# ACE3

## Why we have chosen "Tech for everyone"
We have chosen the topic Tech for everyone. So following this we thought of creating a website for the those people who are not having adequate knowledge to perform important tasks required in this modern era. As a result these people hesitate working with new technologies and mostly do not even try these things. In this website we aim to first make people understand about how basic operations and its functionality from scratch in a very easy way and allow them to simulate these tasks (almost same as the real life technology) parallely on their own . By using this website people will surely enhance their skills of using modern technology.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS

## How to use
*Note: For proper functioning of website, make sure your opened folder is ACE3 (not any parent folder)(on VSCode) and then run index.html file using live server feature of VSCode. Alternatively you can use apache server or any other server to run this project on local machine.*
1. On home page, you will be able to see three containers of which you can select any to start simulation. Say we start with first topic "how to create google account". Click on that container to start simulation.
2. On the left panel, you can see active steps, option to change language and home button for easy navigation. *(Language change feature will work only over stable internet connection)*  
3. Start your simulation parallely while reading instruction (yellow container) on right hand side. This simulation will also show warning (red container) if user make any error while doing simulation.
