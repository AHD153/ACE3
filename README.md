We have chosen the topic Tech for everyone. So following this we thought of creating a website 
for the those people who are not having adequate knowledge to perform important tasks required
in this modern era. As a result these people hesitate working with new technologies and mostly
do not even try these things. In that website we planned to first make people understand
about how   basic operations and its functionality from scratch in a very easy way, then they
will get the chance to simulate these tasks (almost same as the real life technology) on 
their own . By using this website people will surely enhance their skills of using modern 
technology.

We had used tech stack html, css and javasript.
